/**
 * FIFO queue of submitted work with one global limit on the tasks running at once.
 *
 * Owns execution only: it takes a launch lambda, starts it as a coroutine, hands out a slot by the
 * current limit and frees the slot when the task ends. Statuses, task ids and paths are none of its
 * business. Every mutation of its own structures happens inside a coroutine on the injected
 * dispatcher, which is confined to a single worker, so plain collections are safe without locks.
 * The work itself runs in [workContext] instead: a task that reads a blocking stream would
 * otherwise hold the single confined worker and serialize downloads that are meant to run in
 * parallel.
 *
 * Creates no resources but its own scope, and that one is a child of the scope the assembly passes
 * in: the queue starts it, feeds it and cancels only it. The limit comes from the injected [config]
 * stream, so the owner of the configuration decides when the limit changes; the queue only reacts
 * to the new value. Stopping the queue is its own operation: work still in flight is cancelled and
 * awaited within a budget, and new work is refused afterwards.
