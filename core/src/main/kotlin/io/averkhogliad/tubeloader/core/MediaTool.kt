/**
 * Core port for operations on media files. Implementations translate an operation into whatever the
 * backing tool understands (bundled library or an external CLI process).
 *
 * Cancelling the coroutine an operation runs in interrupts it: the implementation kills the whole
 * process tree of the tool it started, orphaned children are not allowed.
 *
 * Closing is for what outlives a coroutine — an idle process, a warm pool. It is idempotent and
 * bounded; the owner of the tool calls it after the work has stopped.
